# Springboot-with-postman
This is a basic Springboot project that I have created. This is not connected to any database. To test this project I have used Postman(It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH). I havent connected it to database yet.
It stores the data as an array of list.
The basic Spring project can be downloaded from https://start.spring.io/ .
